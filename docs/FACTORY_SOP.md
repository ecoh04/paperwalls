## 2. Daily workflow

### 2.1 View new orders

1. Go to **Orders** (or open `/admin/orders`).
2. Use the filter pills: **All**, **New**, **In production**, **Shipped**, **Delivered**, **Awaiting payment**.
3. **New** = paid and ready to produce. Start here each day.

### 2.2 Open an order

1. Click **Open →** on the order row.
2. You’ll see:
   - **Print specs** (highlighted box): wall size(s), finish, application, and **Print files**.
   - **Customer & delivery**: name, email, phone, full address.
   - **Order totals**: subtotal, shipping, total (ZAR).

### 2.3 Produce the order

1. **Download print file(s)**  
   In the **Print specs** section, click **Download print file** (or **Wall 1**, **Wall 2**, etc. when there are multiple walls).  
   Use these exact files for printing; one file per wall when the order has multiple walls with different designs.

2. **Check specs**  
   - **Wall(s):** Dimensions in metres (e.g. 2.50 m × 3.00 m).  
   - **Finish:** Matte, Satin, Textured linen, or Premium fabric.  
   - **Application:** DIY, DIY kit, or Pro installer.

3. **Update status**  
   Use the **Status** dropdown at the top right:  
   - **New** → **In production** when you start printing.  
   - **In production** → **Shipped** when the order is dispatched.  
   - **Shipped** → **Delivered** when the customer has received it (optional; you can leave as Shipped).

### 2.4 Ship the order

1. Pack the printed wallpaper according to your shipping process.
2. Send to the **Customer & delivery** address shown on the order.
3. In the dashboard, set status to **Shipped**.

## 4. Tips

- **Print files:** Always use the file(s) from the dashboard link. Do not use screenshots or emails.
- **Multiple walls:** If there are several “Wall 1”, “Wall 2” links, print each file for the correct wall size.
- **Contact:** Use the customer email or phone on the order if you need to clarify address or delivery.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Can’t log in:** Confirm you’re using the correct factory password. If it was changed, ask for the new one.
- **Order not loading:** Refresh the page. If it still fails, check your internet and try again.
- **Print file won’t open:** Copy the link and open it in a new tab, or try another browser.
